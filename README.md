# hodgkin-huxley-sim
This is a Hodgkin-Huxley action potential simulation developed in Rust. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons are generated. This simulation solves the Hodgkin-Huxley equations using various numerical methods, including the Dormand-Prince pair, Runge-Kutta 4, and Euler's method. It is designed to run on the web using WebAssembly, and the plots are generated using the plotly library.

My motivation for creating this simulation was to explore the combination of WebAssembly with numerical methods.
