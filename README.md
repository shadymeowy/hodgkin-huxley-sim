# hodgkin-huxley-sim
This is a Hodgkin-Huxley model simulation in Rust. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons are generated. The simulation works by solving the Hodgkin-Huxley equations using various numerical methods such as the Dormand-Prince pair, Runge Kutta 4, and Euler's method. The simulation is designed to run on the web using WebAssembly. The plots are generated using the `plotly` library.

The motivation of mine to create this simulation is to try out the WebAssembly and numerical methods together.
